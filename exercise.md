# Exercise Question: Designing a Scalable Web Application on Google Cloud Platform

Imagine you are tasked with designing the architecture for a new web application that needs to be highly scalable, reliable, and cost-effective using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The application is expected to handle a large number of concurrent users and needs to accommodate future growth seamlessly. Based on the resources provided in the Google Cloud cheatsheet, design the infrastructure architecture for this web application.

**Requirements:**

1. The web application will serve dynamic content and needs to be able to handle high traffic loads efficiently.
2. The architecture should be fault-tolerant and highly available to ensure minimal downtime.
3. It should be cost-effective, optimizing resource usage without sacrificing performance.
4. The infrastructure should support continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for rapid development and deployment cycles.
5. Security best practices should be implemented to protect user data and the application from potential threats.

**Tasks:**

1. **Compute Resources:**
   - Choose appropriate compute services from GCP to host the web application. Consider factors such as scalability, performance, and pricing.
   - Design the architecture to auto-scale based on demand to handle traffic spikes effectively.

2. **Networking:**
   - Define the networking architecture to ensure low latency and high throughput for users accessing the web application from various locations.
   - Implement a content delivery network (CDN) to cache and deliver static assets efficiently.

3. **Data Storage:**
   - Select suitable storage solutions for both structured and unstructured data storage requirements of the web application.
   - Design a resilient and scalable database architecture to handle user data and application state.

4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Set up monitoring and logging services to track the performance and health of the infrastructure components.
   - Implement alerting mechanisms to notify administrators of any issues or anomalies.

5. **Security:**
   - Define security measures to protect the application against common threats such as DDoS attacks, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS).
   - Configure access controls and encryption mechanisms to safeguard sensitive data.

6. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Design a CI/CD pipeline using GCP services to automate the build, test, and deployment processes of the web application.
   - Ensure integration with version control systems for efficient code management.

**Deliverables:**

Prepare a detailed architecture diagram illustrating the components of the infrastructure, along with explanations for each decision made. Provide a cost estimation for running the proposed architecture, considering both infrastructure and operational costs.
